<p1>Hi, I’m Ethan. I’m a college student studying Computer Science and Digital Development. I’m passionate about learning programming and building small projects, especially games, tools, and websites. I enjoy solving problems and figuring out how things work. I’m currently focused on improving my coding skills and have aspirations for a Level 6 apprenticeship in software development for my post-college education</p1>
